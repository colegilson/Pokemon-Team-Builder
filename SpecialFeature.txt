Special feature:
The special feature for my project is my "team builder" mode for the website, when clicking the "Build A Team" button, the HUD changes a little bit and restricts the user's input, specifically, it removes the ability to filter the pokemon by type, and to display the original 151 pokemon. However it allows you to "build" a team where you can make the pokemon "shiny" and remove pokemon from your team and add new ones as well. This feature took a fair bit to incorporate, it required me making two different HUD layouts, which I labelled "default", and "alternate" where alternate denotes this team building functionality. This required a fair bit of overhauling my JS, as well as adding some new functions, found towards the end of the JS file. 

How To:
If you are not familiar with pokemon, I do have some items on the website to assist with this, if an incorrect type is input (typing is pokemon's rock, paper, scissors approach for pokemon battling, for any type, it is either strong against, weak to, or neutral in battle) an alert displays all the accurate types. If you do not know the names of any pokemons you can click the button to show the original 151 and see their names, types and what they look like! In the text boxes for input I also had example placeholders. Clicking the "Original 151 Pokemon" button displays all the gen 1 pokemon, released in 1997, and is there if you do not know all the pokemon. Then there is a "Change Their Appearance" button, which will make any future pokemon added to the screen show their alternate sprite. Reset acts as a refresh for the page but keeps the "shiny" flag value. Next is build a team which is discussed in the text above. next is a select box and when a type is selected, all pokemon who share that type will be added to the screen. The last thing available is a text box and a button that will have one pokemon show up.
